## ADR 8: Interactive DAKE

### Context

OTRv3 Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocol lacks strong deniability
properties: partial participation deniability and full message deniability.

We believe the security of OTRv4 can be improved by employing a Deniable
Authenticated Key Exchange (DAKE) protocol.

// TODO: Update this ADR with accurate information about our DAKE decision
