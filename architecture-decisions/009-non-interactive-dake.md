## ADR 8: Non-interactive DAKE

### Context

OTRv3 only provides an interactive AKE.

- Should OTRv4 provide a non-interactive AKE?
- How should pre-keys be published and retrieved? How many? For how long?
- How to associate pre-keys with instance tags? What about user profiles?
- Should the protocol specify HOW to use interactive and non-intractive in
  a hybrid mode and how to automatically fallback from one to another?

### Decision

We decided to postpone the decision to when we have the interactive.

### Consequences
