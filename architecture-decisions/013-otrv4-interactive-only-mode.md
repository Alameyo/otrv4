## ADR 13: "OTRv4 interactive-only" mode

### Context

ADR #010 defines the need for specifying alternative modes for the OTR protocol
version 4.

This document outlines the implications of having a "OTRv4 only" mode to the
spec as per revision 585ba0dfcecf6abc0d30ba0ff0524bce3795110a.

When thinking about the consequences, we had in mind the same scenarios as ADR #011
but restricting the DAKE to the interactive version.

### Decision

(From ADR #010)

TO be defined.

### Consequences

Same as ADR #011, and also the User Profile should not have a Public Shared
Prekey (and it should probably be moved to the end of the User Profile data
structure).

To be defined.
