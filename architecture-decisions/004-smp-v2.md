## ADR 4: OTRv4 SMP

### Context

SMP in OTRv3 uses Diffie Hellman with a 1536-bit group, which gives an estimated
security level of 80 bits. This needs to be upgraded in accordance with our
current target level of 224.

SMP Message 1 and SMP Message 1Q are very similar except for the question
section. In OTRv3, if the user does not define an SMP question, message 1 is
sent. And if they do, message 1Q is sent. This can be combined by making
the question segment optional.

### Decision

SMP in OTRv4 uses elliptic curves to upgrade its security level to 224 - using
the same curve used for the rest of OTRv4 - Ed448.

SMP in OTRv4 doesn't use Message 1Q, only Message 1.

### Consequences

The security level of SMP is upgraded in accordance with the whole protocol's
security level.

Implementers will only need to support one TLV type when the user supplies a
question and when they do not.
