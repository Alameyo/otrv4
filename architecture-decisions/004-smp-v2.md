## ADR 4: SMPv2

**Status**: proposed

### Context

SMP in v3 uses Diffie Hellman 1536 with security level 128, which needs to be upgraded
in accordance with our current target level of 224.

SMP Message 1 and SMP Message 1Q are very similar except for the question section.
In OTR3, if the user does not define an SMP question, Message 1 is sent. And if they do,
message 1Q is sent. This can be combined.

### Decision

SMPv2 in v4 uses Elliptic curves to upgrade its security level to 224. Thus we have
created new TLV records 10-15 to account for this new format.

We have compressed Message 1 and Message 1Q into Message 1. In the case where the user
does not supply an SMP question, the question field of Message 1 can be created with a
length of 0 and a value of NULL.

### Consequences

As a result, the security level of SMP will be upgraded.

Also, implementers will only need to support one TLV type when the user supplies a
question and when they do not.
