## ADR 1: Security Level

### Context

The security level of the protocol can be roughly estimated as the smallest
security level amongst all the cryptographic primitives in use. In general,
there is an inverse relation between security level and speed. For this reason,
the cryptographic primitives should be chosen to have roughly the same security
level as the target security level.

Designing a new version of OTR is an opportunity to improve its security by
using cryptographic primitives with a higher security level. Also, it is an
opportunity to use elliptic curve cryptography for faster computations with the
same security level.

OTRv4 is an open standard, so we want to use crypto primitives with no
intellectual-property claims.

We want the protocol specification to be ready for implementation now.
Therefore, we favor using cryptographic primitives with existing implementations
in various programming languages.

We evaluated two security levels in this context: 128-bit and 224-bit.

### Decision

We will design OTRv4 with a target security level of ~224 bits using elliptic
curve cryptography. In the case that elliptic curves are broken, data message
transcripts of OTRv4 will have classic Diffie-Hellman ~128-bit security.

To achieve ~224-bit elliptic curve security, we chose the curve Ed448 for the
generation of ECDH. In relation to secrets generated with ECDH, we use SHAKE-256
as the hash function since it gives give 256-bit security if the output is 64
bytes and 128 if the output is 32 bytes. Although Ed448 does not have as much
published cryptanalysis as Curve25519, it has a similar construction to
Curve25519 [\[1\]](#references).

To achieve classic Diffie-Hellman ~128-bit security, we use a brace key, which
is described in [ADR 5](https://github.com/otrv4/otrv4/blob/master/architecture-decisions/005-brace-key.md).
We only use SHAKE-256 with an output of 32 bytes when we use the brace key
because it has a security level of 128 bits.

We will use XSalsa20 as our stream cipher because it has a block size of 512
bits compared to AES' block size of 128 bits. XSalsa20 is faster than AES and
immune to timing attacks. Since its nonce is significantly larger, it is safely
generated randomly. It takes 2<sup>249</sup> simple operations against XSalsa20
reduced to 8 rounds to break the cipher.

XSalsa20 will be used with the following parameters: 20 rounds, 192-bits nonces,
and 256-bit keys.

The following KDFs are defined:

```
KDF_1(x) = take_first_32_bytes(SHAKE-256("OTR4" || x))
KDF_2(x) = take_first_64_bytes(SHAKE-256("OTR4" || x))
```

When a keyed cryptographic hash function is expected, we set
`x = key || secret`. To provide cryptographic domain separation when multiple
values need to be derived from the same secret, we set `x = counter || secret`,
where the counter changes for each situation.

In OTRv4, long-lived key authentication can happen by using SMP or comparing
fingerprints. We take the first 56 bytes of the SHAKE-256 hash function for
generating fingerprints from the long-lived public keys. This results in a long
448-bit (56 byte) fingerprint. The full length fingerprint will be used for SMP
authentication.

### Consequences

Choosing Ed448 requires implementations of Ed448 curve equations, and SMP
primitives have changed to Ed448.

The size of fingerprints is increased to 56 bytesq.
